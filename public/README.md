**What is `simplest-api?**

This is an organisation to collect implementations of a tiny API that can be used as an example of how different web frameworks operate.
The API simply returns the list of products from Mozilla's `fetch()` [documentation](https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/blob/main/fetch/fetch-json/products.json).
